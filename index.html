<p>Pupylation plays a key role in regulating various protein functions as a crucial post-translational  modification of prokaryotes. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of pupylation, it is  important to identify pupylation substrates and sites accurately. Several computational methods  have been developed to identify pupylation sites because the traditional experimental methods  are time-consuming and labor-sensitive. With the existing computational methods, the  experimentally annotated pupylation sites are used as the positive training set and the  remaining non-annotated lysine residues as the negative training set to build classifiers to  predict new pupylation sites from the unknown proteins. However, the remaining non-annotated  lysine residues may contain pupylation sites which have not been experimentally validated yet.  Unlike previous methods, in this study, the experimentally annotated pupylation sites were used  as the positive training set whereas the remaining non-annotated lysine residues were used as  the unlabeled training set. A novel method named PUL-PUP was proposed to predict pupylation  sites by using positive-unlabeled learning technique. Our experimental results indicated that  PUL-PUP outperforms the other methods significantly for the prediction of pupylation sites. As an  application, PUL-PUP was also used to predict the most likely pupylation sites in non-annotated  lysine sites.</p>
